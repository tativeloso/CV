      I am a former student-athlete</a>, I had the honor to achieve
      high-level competitions as an anthlete and successfuly graduate
      in Business Administration in California. As an athlete, and coming
      from a family of former high-level athletes, I am a true believer that
      high-level sports teach people many skill and "real-life" lessons. Besides
      being athletes, my parents also started a couple of businesses of their
      own. I believe growing up listening to the conversations and seeing them
      run their businesses strongly contributed to my career choice. However,
      the unexpected interest in programming was a good surpise I had when
      I took an advanced Excel class during university. During this class we
      learned macros, VBA, and how quickly I understood this "new language" and
      everything I could do with it fascinated me. Since then, I have been
      working with Business but researched and took online courses to learn
      and improve my programming skills.
